[8/8/2014] Add sequences from 60+ new species from Abeillia_abeillei [6658] to Aphrastura_masafuerae [6858]

[8/8/2014] Updating accessions file from Amaurospiza_moesta [1] to Basileuterus_basilicus [700] (616 new sequences added)

[8/8/2014] Acrocephalus palustris (S11): cytochrome-b data is from genbank accession number EU016091. 
The genbank taxonomy lists this species as Acrocephalus palustris sinensis. However, the study title suggests 
that this is the Japanese marsh warbler (Locustella paulstris sinensis - a subspecies of Megalurus palustris 
following the Jetz et al taxonomy). It is clearly not A. palustris. Source for cyt-b for A. palustris changed to AJ004774
