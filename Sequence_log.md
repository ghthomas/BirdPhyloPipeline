Log of updates to sequence data
===============================

This file contains notes on revisions to the sequence accession file SequenceAccessions_working.csv. The file SequenceAccessions_Jetz_et_al.csv is not intended for editing. Specific details of additions of species or sequences will not generally be recorded.
Changes to existing accessions (e.g. if species assignment in genbank is incorrect) should be documented.

[03/02/2015] Accessions file completed. Added new loci (TGFB2, Rho1, ACO1, MUSK, AK1, RAG2, CMOS, MYC) plus synonym checks on species names. Total now 8067 species with at least one loci sequenced. Gene totals are below for Jetz et al, Burleigh et al (supermatrix) and new data.

[7/9/2014] Finished updating accessions list for missing species. 7799 species with sequence data from at least one of the loci used in Jetz et al. 

[6/9/2014] Added accessions searching through all missing species. Started second pass to catch any oversights [A-D checked]. 7767 species with sequence data. 

[5/9/2014] Added accessions to Phytotoma_raimondii [9028]. 7434 species with data.

[8/8/2014] Acrocephalus palustris (S11): cytochrome-b data is from genbank accession number EU016091. The genbank taxonomy lists this species as Acrocephalus palustris sinensis. However, the study title suggests that this is the Japanese marsh warbler (Locustella paulstris sinensis - a subspecies of Megalurus palustris following the Jetz et al taxonomy). It is clearly not A. palustris. Source for cyt-b for A. palustris changed to AJ004774
